         <h3 class="section-title">How Do I know If Showgirl Temple Is Right For Me?</h3>
         <p class="section-description"><p><h4>Do I need dance experience?</h4> Nope! Many of my students have no or very little dance experience and have a great time learning. I’ve trained in various styles of dance since age 3, and I’m still learning myself! But I love to nerd out on body mechanics and how to help students connect with their physical bodies to provide a solid foundation for growing skills and dancing safely through life.</p>

         <p><h4>I actually have a lot of dance experience, so I really need classes to start performing Burlesque?</h4> Even growing up dancing I’ve learned a lot of special tricks with audience engagement and clothing removal in Burlesque classes that my ballet and jazz instructors never taught. And 7+ years into performing Burlesque I still take classes from more experienced Burleskers. Your dance background will serve you well, and these classes can give you a jump start into a new performance style and introduce you to a new scene.</p>

         <p><h4>What do you mean by body positive?</h4>  I believe that any and every body has the potential to enjoy Burlesque and entertain other people, and ShowGirl Temple is a safe, supportive space to try on your Fabulous self. I’ll work with you to make adjustments needed in movement and training to ensure you feel good in your body and enjoy the dance.  As a certified fitness instructor I’m also careful to be sure you warm up at the beginning of a class and stretch at the end to keep your body and heart happy.</p>

         <p><h4>Do you teach a particular style of Burlesque?</h4> I teach basic moves like bumps, grinds, shimmies, strutting and turns that are often used in the original era of Burlesque (1920s-60-ish) as building blocks for movement and good ways to warm up and train your body, along with bits I’ve learned in ballet, Jazz, belly dance and samba. I also focus on building an engaging stage presence so you feel good entertaining an audience. Whatever music you use, story you want to tell or feelings you want to convey are yours — This is a celebration of you and your willingness to share yourself — I’m here to help you shine.</p>

         <p><h4>What if I don’t ever want to get on stage?</h4> No worries,
           many students do that!  Sometimes just knowing you can shake it is all you need for a self confidence boost or you’re just seeking some fun, ShowGirl Temple Welcomes you!</p>

         <p><h4>Why do you call it a temple?</h4> ShowGirl Temple is an extension of our bodies, which I believe are sacred and meant to be celebrated. My own performance comes from a desire to release shame and reclaim and celebrate sexual power. Thinking about this space as a temple provides grounding and connection outside of ourselves, and a safe space for exploring and focusing our energy.  I believe my space in this world is to share the joy I’ve found in Burlesque with any who are ready to strut through the door and it’s bigger than me as a person.  Don’t panic if this sounds woo-woo! In ShowGirl Temple we focus our energy through dance and having fun with each other — we are after all celebrating!</p>

         <p><h4>Tenants of ShowGirl Temple</h4>
           I honor myself by giving my all within ShowGirl Temple.</br>
           Temple by respecting their desires and space within the temple (outside the temple is good too!), and by cheering for them in their process.</br>
           I honor my process by communicating any concerns or challenges that come up for me while I’m in ShowGirl Temple and by transforming self judgements into opportunities for growth.<br>
           I dance in celebration of my most Fabulous self.</br>
           As ShowGirl Temple supports me in shining brighter, I will share my sparkle and joy beyond ShowGirl Temple.

          Fill yourself up with laughter, self love and sass in this 3-week Introduction to Burlesque with High Priestess of Tease Eva D'Luscious.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Learn Eva's Burlesque Basics, including body mechanics of Bumps, Grinds, Shimmies and Struts, the foundation of Stage Presence, Eva's 3Ps of Striptease and Tassel Twirling, and put these skills to work in a sassy and sultry striptease choreography you can perform at home for a loved one, or for yourself!

        </p>
        <p class="description">
          In ShowGirl Temple we dance in worship of our sexy selves, honor and connect with all aspects of femininity -- ferocity, frustration, fear, joy, determination, sweetness, sexuality. We break free of shame and step into the most glittering manifestations of ourselves, shining our light for all, but most importantly for ourselves.

        <p class="description">
          ShowGirl is Body Positive and welcomes varied skill levels and women of all backgrounds.
